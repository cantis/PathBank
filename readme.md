A continuation of my 'Learn by doing it series' (it is kind of a series now). 

The idea of this one is to get it started with almost nothing and then get the CI / CD on google configured and running fully then commmense development of the app while borrowing from what I've learned and from the Coin Purse applciation.

Initialized and created a 'walking skeleton' that does nothing but hello world and then add a docker file and get it up and running on Google Cloud Platform as well as building on Github. Got the CI working and connecing up the CD! yeaa
